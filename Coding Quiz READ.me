# Coding-Quiz


What I have done in this assignment

-  I created all the questionsl, choices, and correct answers
- Then I added the score, current score, and countdown
- Then I wrote added a timer and when you clicked the wrong answer you would lose 10 secs
- When the quiz was over I added a highscore section where you can add you initals and see the score you got
- I also implemented the local storage to keep all the initals saved to the browser
